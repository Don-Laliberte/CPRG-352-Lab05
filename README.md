# CPRG-352-Lab05
This repo contains one of my Labs from my Web Dev course at SAIT. It features a basic login page with added security using JSTL libraries.
# What I learned
•Using JSTL libraries to prevent injection on input fields. Same idea applicable to modern websites.

•Using JDBC to handle Username and Passwords
